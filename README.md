# Web Application Security Assessment - Educational Case Study

# Project Overview
This repository documents the methodology and learnings from an authorized security assessment conducted as part of cybersecurity training. The purpose is to demonstrate security testing approaches while maintaining ethical standards and responsible disclosure practices.

**Note**: All sensitive information, including target details, internal infrastructure data, and specific vulnerabilities have been redacted to protect the organization's security.

# Assessment Scope
- Authorized penetration testing on a production web application
- Focus on common web application vulnerabilities
- Ethical testing following industry standards

#  Testing Methodology

# 1. Reconnaissance & Information Gathering
- Domain analysis (redacted)
- Technology stack identification
- Endpoint enumeration

# 2. Vulnerability Assessment
## SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Testing
- **Approach**: Parameter manipulation in search functionality
- **Methodology**: Internal service enumeration through URL parameters
- **Tools Used**: Browser developer tools, manual testing

## Input Validation Testing
- **XSS Testing**: Various payload types attempted
- **SQL Injection**: Standard and encoded payloads
- **Command Injection**: OS command execution attempts

##  Key Findings & Learnings

## Confirmed Vulnerabilities
1. **SSRF (Medium Severity)**
   - Internal network reconnaissance possible
   - Port scanning capabilities identified
   - Limited data exfiltration potential

2. **Input Reflection Issues (Low Severity)**
   - User input reflected in multiple page contexts
   - Properly sanitized against code execution

## Security Strengths Observed
- Robust WAF implementation
- Effective input sanitization
- Proper error handling
- Secure session management

##  Mitigation Strategies

## For SSRF Vulnerabilities
- Implement URL allowlisting for internal requests
- Network-level restrictions on server outbound connections
- Input validation for URL parameters

##  Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Web Application Testing**
  - SSRF exploitation techniques
  - Input validation testing
  - Session management analysis

- **Security Tools**
  - Browser Developer Tools
  - Webhook services for testing
  - Manual exploitation techniques

- **Methodologies**
  - OWASP testing framework
  - Responsible disclosure practices
  - Vulnerability assessment reporting

##  Responsible Disclosure
This assessment was conducted with proper authorization following ethical guidelines:
- Written permission obtained before testing
- All findings reported to the organization
- Sensitive information redacted in public documentation
- No actual exploitation or damage caused
